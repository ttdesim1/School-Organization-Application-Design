# School-Organization-Application-Design

Date: October 2020 – November 2020 

The goal of this academic project is to design a school organization app that allows parents to
keep track of their children’s assignments and zoom classes during the pandemic. It features a
shared calendar between all children that allows parents to see each of their school events in one place. 
Parents can create profiles for their children that connect to their school accounts to see their schedules 
and assignments. Parents may also see if their child is present or absent in a current class. Adobe XD was 
used to create the design and prototype.
